# Daily Coding Problem Solutions

Hi! In this personal project, I am solving logical programming tasks/questions, provided by [DailyCodingProblem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com).

## Tasks

### #1

[Solution (Jupyter Notebook)](#1.ipynb)

> This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number `k`, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to `k`.
_For example_, given `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and `k = 17`, return true since `10 + 7` is `17`.

### #2

[Solution (Jupyter Notebook)](#2.ipynb)

> This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index `i` of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at `i`.

_For example_, if our input was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the expected output would be `[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]`. If our input was `[3, 2, 1]`, the expected output would be `[2, 3, 6]`.

_Follow-up_: what if you can't use division?
